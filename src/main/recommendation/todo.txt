# TODO: categories of vars --> some need to be one-hot-encoded, scaled,
#  names in dataset & names in BikeCAD files
# we might want to return multiple similar bikes WITH scores (80% similar)

# two broad directions:
# * performance optimization (time vs accuracy) [been done, literature review needed]
# * human - AI collaboration (user data?)
# Multi-fidelity -- possible with a human in the loop
